# Lab-2
The second project I worked on in my Business Analytics course by Azubi Africa.

This project entailed the use of different nodes as we try to follow the Cross Industry standard Process for Data Mining(CRISP-DM) method of Machine Learning. This method has 6 steps which are;
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

This project focused on the first 3 steps. Some of the nodes used are the geometric Map node for visualization of different coordinates, use of target encoding to deal with categorical data, column expressions to include columns in the data table, and using the normalizer node to standardize the numerical data.
